# CPlug

Note: I set up a small pre-commit script that runs `cloc` and `tree` to show the number of lines of code per language and the directory tree. If you are committing, either install CLOC (Count Lines of Code) and tree, which can be installed with `brew install cloc`, `brew install tree`, or delete the script in `.git/hooks`.

CPlug is currently pre-aplha, but several modules are usable.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/michaeljklein/CPlug/wiki) for more information.
